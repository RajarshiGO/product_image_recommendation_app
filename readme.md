# Image similarity based E-commerce recommendation engine
This is a image similarity based search engine that is intended to ne used as a recommendation system in E-commerce platforms to recommend products similar to the items that the customer has already viewed. The entire has been implemented on the Amazon product images dataset published online by [Amazon-Berkeley](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). A pre-trained [VGG16](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) model available in keras-tensorflow is used as a feature extractor to form feature vector of each image in the database and then for a new image, the corresponding feature vector is compared with every feature vector in the database to find potential matches. Considering the massive size of the dataset, the conventional Nearest Neighbor Search algorithm becomes very slow in real time and therefore, we have used approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm which is conveniently implemented in Spotify/Annoy. The entire image database is hosted in Microsoft Azure storage service and the web app makes API calls to this service using the [Azure python API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/azure-sdk-overview) to retrieve the recommended images.

The recommendation system has been hosted online as a web application with Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://rajarshigo-product-image-recommendation-app-app-k1n5ko.streamlitapp.com/).
